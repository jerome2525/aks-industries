1. SCOPE OF WORK

The Developer agrees to design, develop, and deliver a Progressive Web Application (PWA) for the Client's socks manufacturing and store operations, as described in the Project Plan entitled "Socks Manufacturing and Store Operations – Project Plan (Client Proposal)" (the "Project Plan"), which is attached or referenced and forms part of this Agreement.

Deliverables include, but are not limited to:

(a) Foundation and access (auth, roles, branches, stores, materials, products)
(b) Barcode generation and print for products
(c) Manufacturing module (4-phase flow per branch)
(d) Stores module (deliveries and sales per store, barcode scanning)
(e) Admin dashboard (reports, filters, charts)
(f) PWA installability and polish for rollout

Project timeline. The target completion period is three (3) months from kickoff, subject to timely payment, feedback, and access to information as needed by the Developer. The project may be completed earlier than this target or may run slightly over the target depending on scope, feedback, and other factors; both parties accept this flexibility and will work in good faith to meet the target while ensuring quality delivery.


2. PROJECT PRICE

The total fixed price for the development of the Application (the "Project Price") is One Hundred Eighty Thousand Philippine Pesos (PHP 180,000.00), excluding hosting, domain, and ongoing maintenance as set out below.


3. PAYMENT TERMS

3.1 Initial Payment (Upfront)

Thirty percent (30%) of the Project Price shall be paid by the Client to the Developer before development work begins: PHP 54,000.00, due upon signing of this Agreement (or as otherwise agreed in writing).

This upfront payment is non-refundable and secures the Developer's commitment and project slot.

3.2 Phase-Based Installments

The remaining seventy percent (70%) of the Project Price, PHP 126,000.00, shall be paid in installments tied to the completion of each implementation phase:

Phase 1 – Setup and auth; admin: branches, stores, materials, products. Amount: PHP 21,000.00. Due upon completion and acceptance of Phase 1.

Phase 2 – Barcode generation (view/print per product). Amount: PHP 21,000.00. Due upon completion and acceptance of Phase 2.

Phase 3 – Manufacturing (4-phase flow per branch). Amount: PHP 21,000.00. Due upon completion and acceptance of Phase 3.

Phase 4 – Stores (delivery and sales, barcode scan). Amount: PHP 21,000.00. Due upon completion and acceptance of Phase 4.

Phase 5 – Dashboard (reports, filters, charts). Amount: PHP 21,000.00. Due upon completion and acceptance of Phase 5.

Phase 6 – Polish and rollout (PWA, validation, handover). Amount: PHP 21,000.00. Due upon completion and acceptance of Phase 6.

Total phase installments: PHP 126,000.00.

Each installment is due within seven (7) calendar days after the Developer notifies the Client that the phase is complete and the Client has had a reasonable opportunity to review (or within a different period if agreed in writing). The Developer is not obliged to start or continue the next phase until the installment for the completed phase has been paid.

3.3 Method of Payment

Payments shall be made via bank transfer or other method agreed in writing. The Developer will provide payment details. The Client is responsible for any bank or transfer fees on the Client's side.


4. HOSTING AND INFRASTRUCTURE

To avoid the Client having to purchase and manage their own cloud infrastructure, the Developer will host the Application on the Developer's chosen platforms (e.g. Railway for backend, Supabase for frontend or as applicable) and pass the hosting cost to the Client.

Backend hosting: PHP 3,000.00 per month.
Frontend hosting: PHP 3,000.00 per month.
Total hosting: PHP 6,000.00 per month.

The Developer will manage setup, deployment, and infrastructure maintenance. Hosting is billed monthly in advance (or as otherwise agreed) and is separate from the Project Price and from the maintenance fee below.


5. MAINTENANCE

After delivery of the Application, the Client may engage the Developer for ongoing maintenance.

Maintenance fee: PHP 8,000.00 per month.

What maintenance includes. Maintenance covers only (1) updates (e.g. dependency updates, server/runtime updates, security patches) and (2) fixing breaks (e.g. fixing bugs, restoring service when something stops working). It does not include new features, additional functionality, or other development work; those will be quoted separately if the Client requests them.

This Agreement does not oblige the Client to retain maintenance after delivery; it only states the fee and scope if the Client chooses to engage the Developer for it.


6. DOMAIN NAME

The Client will choose the domain name for the Application. The cost of the domain (registration and renewal) depends on the chosen name and availability and is paid by the Client (either directly or reimbursed to the Developer if the Developer purchases it on the Client's behalf). The Developer may assist with registration and DNS setup.


7. TRANSITION AND MIGRATION (WHEN CLIENT STOPS SERVICE)

If the Client decides to stop using the Developer's hosting and/or maintenance services (e.g. to move to another developer or their own server), the Developer agrees to provide reasonable assistance so the Client can take over the Application. This includes:

(a) Providing access to or delivery of all source code and project files for the Application
(b) Assisting with export of data (e.g. database dumps) in a usable format
(c) Providing setup or migration support (e.g. documentation, handover to the Client's new developer) within a reasonable scope and period (e.g. up to 30 days after termination of hosting/maintenance, or as agreed)

The Developer may charge a one-time transition fee for extensive migration work beyond basic handover, to be agreed in writing. Unless otherwise agreed, basic handover (code, data export, and reasonable instructions) will be provided without extra charge.


8. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

Upon full payment of the Project Price (all upfront and phase installments), ownership of the deliverables (source code, designs, and materials created specifically for the Client under this Agreement) shall transfer to the Client, subject to any pre-existing or third-party components that remain under their respective licenses.

Until full payment is received, the Developer retains ownership of the deliverables. The Client is granted a license to use the Application for its intended purpose during the project and after delivery, but full ownership transfers only after the Project Price is paid in full.


9. CONFIDENTIALITY

Each party agrees to keep confidential any non-public information received from the other in connection with this Agreement (business data, technical details, login credentials, etc.) and to use it only for performing this Agreement. This obligation survives termination of the Agreement. Confidentiality does not apply to information that is publicly available, independently developed, or rightfully received from a third party without restriction.


10. WARRANTY AND LIMITATION

The Developer warrants that the work will be performed in a professional manner and that the deliverables will substantially conform to the Project Plan at the time of delivery. The Client must report any defect in writing within thirty (30) days after delivery of the relevant phase or the final delivery. The Developer will correct material defects that are due to the Developer's work at no additional charge during that period.

Except as stated above, the work and deliverables are provided "as is." The Developer does not warrant uninterrupted or error-free operation, and is not liable for issues arising from third-party services (hosting, APIs, browsers), Client modifications, or misuse. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Developer's total liability under this Agreement shall not exceed the total amount paid by the Client to the Developer under this Agreement.


11. TERMINATION

By Client. The Client may terminate this Agreement at any time by giving written notice. The Client remains liable for (a) the 30% upfront payment if work has started, and (b) payment for all phases completed and accepted before termination.

By Developer. The Developer may terminate if the Client fails to pay any due amount within fourteen (14) days after written reminder, or materially breaches this Agreement and does not cure within fourteen (14) days after written notice. Upon such termination, the Client remains liable for all amounts due for work completed.

Effect of termination. On termination, the Developer will deliver work product completed up to the date of termination. Section 7 (Transition and Migration), Section 8 (Intellectual Property, to the extent already paid), Section 9 (Confidentiality), Section 10 (Limitation), and this Section 11 survive termination.


12. GENERAL

Governing law. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the Republic of the Philippines.

Entire agreement. This Agreement, together with the Project Plan, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes prior discussions. Changes must be in writing and signed by both parties.

Notices. Notices under this Agreement may be sent by email to the addresses above (or as updated in writing). Notice is deemed given when sent.

Severability. If any part of this Agreement is held invalid, the rest remains in effect.
